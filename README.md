# ML-SMS-Spam-Classifier
[python|sklearn|streamlit|pycharm]


The SMS Spam Classifier is a machine learning project aimed at automatically identifying and classifying spam messages from genuine ones in SMS texts. The project involves several stages, starting with data cleaning and exploration, followed by text preprocessing, model building, evaluation, improvement, website development, and deployment.

1) Data Collection: Gather SMS data containing spam and non-spam messages.

2) Data Cleaning & EDA: Remove noise, duplicates, and missing values. Explore data to understand patterns.

3) Text Preprocessing: Prepare text data by tokenization, removing stopwords, and special characters.

4) Model Building: Train the classifier using algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVC,K-Nearest Neighbors,Decision Trees,Random Forest,Gradient Boosting.

5) Evaluation: Measure model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6) Improvement: Optimize the model through hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.

7) Website Development: used streamlit Create a user-friendly web application for SMS classification.

8) Deployment: Host the SMS Spam Classifier on a web server or cloud platform for real-time use.
